# CS186: Introduction to Database Systems (Fall 2023, UCB)

This repository contains coursework from **CS186: Introduction to Database Systems**, which I took in Fall 2023 at UC Berkeley. The course covers the design, implementation, and use of database systems, focusing on relational databases, SQL, query optimization, and transaction management.

## Contents:

- **Projects**: Contains course projects focusing on the implementation of database systems, including relational database design, query execution, and indexing.

## Key Concepts Covered:

- **Relational Databases**: Understanding the principles behind relational databases, including tables, relationships, and normalization.
- **SQL**: Writing complex queries to retrieve, manipulate, and manage data within a relational database system.
- **Indexing**: Implementing and analyzing the performance of various indexing techniques (e.g., B-trees, hash indexes).
- **Query Optimization**: Techniques for optimizing query execution plans and improving database performance.
- **Transactions and Concurrency Control**: Understanding ACID properties, transaction isolation, and concurrency control mechanisms.

## How to Navigate:

- **Projects**: All projects are located under the `Projects/` directory, each containing relevant code and documentation for database design, query execution, and system performance optimization.
